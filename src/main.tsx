 * Mesurer — the inspector that replaced spacingjs on 2026-09-21. Where spacingjs did one
 * thing (Alt-hover two elements, read the gap), this brings guides, rulers, measurements,
 * X-ray, colour and type sampling, and annotations that can be handed to an agent. Press M
 * to toggle it; its other single-key shortcuts stand down inside inputs, textareas and
 * contenteditable, so they do not fight the forms in this app.
 *
 * Dev only, and the ternary is what makes that true rather than merely intended. Gating the
 * *render* is not enough: `lazy()` is called while this module evaluates, so the factory —
 * and the `import()` inside it — survives into the build as its own chunk however dead the
 * JSX below is. Verified: that shape emitted a 365 KB chunk and a 31 KB stylesheet into
 * `dist/`. Putting the whole `lazy(…)` call in the true branch of a condition that
 * `import.meta.env.DEV` inlines to `false` is what lets the bundler fold it away, which is
 * the same trick the spacingjs line used — the import has to sit inside the dead code, not
 * beside it.
 *
 * A top-level `import { Mesurer } from 'mesurer'` would be worse still: the package marks
 * `sideEffects: ["*.css"]`, so the stylesheet ships to production even with nothing left to
 * render it.
