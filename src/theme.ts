/**
 * Component token overrides — the only mechanism this app uses to restyle a Blend
 * component. No global CSS, no `!important`, nothing anchored on Blend's internal DOM.
 *
 * ⚠️ Overrides REPLACE, they do not merge. The docs site says partial `BUTTONV2` overrides
 * are "merged on top of the active light or dark defaults"; the installed 0.0.37 does not
 * do that. All 81 slots in `initComponentTokens.ts` resolve as
 * `componentTokens.X ?? getXTokens(...)`, and there is no deep-merge helper in the package
 * (rule 2 — source is truth, not the docs). So every override here starts from the
 * component's own getter and edits one path. Handing in a partial object would discard the
 * component's whole token tree, dark variant included.
 *
 * ⚠️ Overrides are also GLOBAL. A slot set here applies to every instance in the app. Where
 * only one instance should move, use `scopedTokens` below instead.

 * token is gray[200] (#E1E4EA), one step darker on the ramp. On a single chip the difference
 * is invisible; across twenty-two of them it is the difference between a field of soft
 * shapes and a grid of hard-edged boxes, which is the whole point of the subtle style.
 *
 * `noFill` takes the same value, and that one is not a nicety. The organiser's palette draws
 * an *unchosen* chip as NO_FILL (ColumnOrganiser.tsx), and Blend borders that one in
 * gray[950] — near-black, which down a column of twenty-nine reads as a stack of outlined
 * boxes rather than as a list. Node 4911:111688, the design's own default chip, is this same
 * #ECEFF3 hairline with its fill switched off, so in the design the two states differ by
 * their fill and their glyph and by nothing else.
 *
 * Two more colours draw under these tokens now, and both are undone the same way. A field the
 * user wrote is WARNING and a field the report groups by is PURPLE (ColumnOrganiser.tsx), and
 * Blend paints each of those across the entire chip: orange[500] all the way round an
 * unfilled one, orange[50]/purple[50] under a filled one. That reads as three kinds of chip
 * rather than one chip saying three things — and the wash also swallows the gray[50] that is
 * the only mark of a chosen field, so a grouped chip on purple[50] (#FAF5FF) sat there
 * looking unchosen beside its neighbours. Both fall back to the neutral fill and the neutral
 * hairline. What is left carrying the colour is the word itself — orange[500] unfilled and
 * orange[600] filled, purple[600] for grouped — which is the part being read.
 *
 * The Fields step's older round chips — the flow's only other NO_FILL — render unwrapped
 * (FieldsStep.tsx:862) and keep Blend's border.
 *

 * so this override is two paths deep and nothing else moves.

/**
 * The organiser's right-hand list — the palette's tokens with Blend's tag colours put back.
 *
 * `fieldTagTokens` sends WARNING and PURPLE to the neutral fill because a palette chip is one
 * of twenty-nine, and down a column that long a coloured wash stops being a mark and becomes
 * the weather. A row's pill is the opposite case. There is one of it, it sits alone in the
 * slot the aggregation select would have taken, and it is naming the treatment the row is
 * under rather than being an item in a list — so the wash is doing the work there, and
 * "Grouped by" keeps its purple, "Custom" its orange.
 *
 * Only TAGV2 goes back. The select's gray[400] trigger stays, because the rows are where that
 * select lives.

/**
 * The report config detail sheet's spacing, set on Blend's own tokens rather than on the
 * markup around them — see ConfigDetailSheet.tsx.
 *
 * Two values move, and both are the panel's own rhythm rather than anything about a single
 * row:
 *
 * `DRAWER.content.padding` 16/20 → 24. Blend's values are a bottom-sheet inset — right on a
 * phone, thin on a 600px reference panel, where 20px leaves the title, the key column and the
 * preview table all running to within 20px of the edge and nothing reading as a margin. 24 is
 * the step the pages already use, and because DrawerHeader, DrawerBody and DrawerFooter all
 * read this one token, the header/body boundary opens to 48px at the same time — which is
 * what lets the sheet separate its zones with space instead of a rule (better-layout: group
 * with space, not lines).
 *
 * `KEYVALUEPAIRV2.gap.vertical` 4 → 8. Only the stacked rows use it (Metrics, Filters, Column
 * Order, File Name Template), and their values wrap to two 20px lines. At 4px the key sits
 * closer to its value than the value's own lines sit to each other, so the pair reads as one
 * paragraph and the list loses its keys; 8px still leaves the 20px between those rows at
 * 2.5x the gap inside one, which is the ratio that makes a group read as a group.
 *
 * Scoped by a nested ThemeProvider for the same reason as sectionTabsTokens: DRAWER is also
 * every mobile select panel Blend opens (SingleSelectDrawer and friends), which want the
 * bottom-sheet inset they were designed with.
